## Image Gallery

A full-stack gallery web application that allows anyone to view other galleries or create their own and upload photos into it.

##### Technical overview

This is a full-stack application which runs [react.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) in [ðŸ—‚ front-end](frontend) and [Laravel Lumen](https://github.com/laravel/lumen) in [back-end](backend) as a RESTful API.

It also uses [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for storing any photos uploaded by the user, in conjuction with a [MySQL database](https://www.mysql.com/) for storing various other data.

> Before any photo is stored, it is resized to form a thumbnail which is stored alongside the original version of the photo. This thumbnail is shown when listing the gallery photos, and the original photo is shown when the user opens to preview the photo.

For authentication, the application uses the Password and Token-based Authentication. _See [JSON Web Tokens (JWT)](https://jwt.io/)_

Lastly it provides docker/docker-compose files to ease running the application.

:white_check_mark: Complete in 1 week.\
:white_check_mark: Make appropriate use of well estabilished libraries and frameworks.\
:white_check_mark: Pages must be restricted to ensure that user-only tasks are restricted to logged in users and the correct user.\
:white_check_mark: Thumbnail images should be precomputed to prevent the browser or web server having to scale down large images on the fly for the purpose of displaying thumbnails.\
:white_check_mark: Demonstrate best practices

<hr>

:white_large_square: A user should be able to view a photo gallery as a slideshow which transitions automatically from one image to another.\

#### Getting started

> ###### Notes:
>
> This app stores the uploaded photos to the AWS S3 service. In order to [get your credentials for the app](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys), please:
>
> 1. Sign in to the AWS S3 Console
> 2. Create a bucket named `tccsimagegallery` in the `us-east-2` region and with `all` public access allowed.

```bash
# Copy the example .env file and configure it
cp .env.example .env

# Open the .env file
nano .env

# Edit with your configurations
...
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=imagegallery # or your own db name (you will need to have this mysql database create on your machine)
DB_USERNAME= # insert db username
DB_PASSWORD= # insert db password

# see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID= # insert
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= # insert
...
```

3. Navigate to the root of the repo (`tccs-image-gallery`) and execute:

```bash
# Build the docker images (ig-db, ig-backend, ig-frontend)
docker-compose --env-file backend/.env build

# Start up the containers in dettached mode, passing in the .env file
docker-compose --env-file backend/.env up

# Enter backend php server bash
docker exec -it ig-backend bash
    # - Generate the JWT secret used to sign the authentication token
    $ php artisan jwt:secret
    # - Migrate database
    $ php artisan migrate
    # Exit bash
    $ exit()
```

3. Go to `https://localhost:3000/`
